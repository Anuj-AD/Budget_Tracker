Budget Tracking and Management using Google Sheets and Appsheet/glideapps
This repo aims to make a budget managemnt app using Glideapps (Free) or Appsheet(Paid)
The Google Sheets has various tabs where data (monthly usage/avaialable balance/expenditure trends) is automatacally added using scrips and formulas. This is done as to reduce the computation required on the app's side. Appsheet/Glideapps is used as a webapp only for inputting the data or retrieving the data.
